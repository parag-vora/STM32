This repository demonstrates the integration and usage of FreeRTOS on the STM32 Nucleo board, leveraging the CMSIS-RTOS v2 (CMSIS-RTOS2) interface.

## About CMSIS-RTOS2 ##
CMSIS-RTOS2 is a standardized RTOS interface designed for Arm® Cortex® processor-based devices. It provides a consistent API that simplifies the integration of RTOS functionality into applications, 
offering significant benefits for developers and the software industry.

## Key Features and Benefits ##
Basic RTOS Features: CMSIS-RTOS2 offers essential RTOS capabilities commonly needed in embedded systems.
Unified API: The consistent API reduces the learning curve and simplifies the sharing of software components.
Middleware Compatibility: Middleware components built using CMSIS-RTOS2 are RTOS-agnostic, enabling easier adaptation to different RTOS implementations.
Standardized Templates: CMSIS-RTOS2 templates are freely available, making it simple to start new projects with robust RTOS support.
